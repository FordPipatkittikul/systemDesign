# Concurrency != Parallelism

- Parallelism

Definition: Parallelism is about actually executing multiple tasks at the same time, typically using multiple processors or cores.

Example: Like having multiple waiters, each serving a table at the same time.

Focus: Doing multiple tasks simultaneously.

- Concurrency - providing an illusion of doing more than one thing at the same time.

Definition: Concurrency is about dealing with multiple tasks at the same time conceptually. It doesnâ€™t necessarily mean they are running at the same instant, just that progress is being made on all of them.

Example: Like a single waiter managing several tables by quickly switching between them. Only one task is being executed at a time, but the work seems simultaneous because of rapid context switching.

Focus: Managing multiple tasks by switching.

# Processes

- A process is an independent program in execution.
- Each process has its own memory space and resources.
- Processes do not share memory (communication between processes requires Inter-Process Communication like File, signal, sockets, pipes)

# Threads

- A thread is a lightweight unit of execution within a process.
- Threads share the same memory of their parent process.
- Easier to create and manage than processes.

# Thread Pools

- A thread pool is a collection of pre-created, reusable threads.
- Instead of creating a new thread every time, tasks are assigned to threads in the pool.
- Improves performance by reducing the overhead of creating and destroying threads repeatedly.
