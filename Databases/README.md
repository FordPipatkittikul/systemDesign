# indexes

In databases, indexes are data structures used to improve the speed of data retrieval operations on a table at the cost of additional space and maintenance overhead. Think of an index as a **shortcut** to quickly locate the rows in a table that match certain search criteria, similar to how an index in a book helps you find a topic quickly without reading the whole book.

**Why Indexes are Useful**:

1) Faster Query Performance: Indexes significantly speed up retrieval operations (e.g., SELECT queries) by allowing the database to find rows more efficiently. For example, searching for a row in a table without an index might require scanning the entire table (a full table scan), while an index allows the database to quickly find the relevant rows.

2) Optimized Sorting: If you frequently perform queries with ORDER BY clauses, indexes can speed up the sorting process, as the index may already be sorted.

3) Efficient JOINs: Indexes are particularly useful when joining large tables. They help the database quickly locate matching rows across different tables.

4) Improved Uniqueness Enforcement: Indexes are often used to enforce primary key or unique constraints. They ensure that no two rows in a table have the same value for a column that is marked as unique.

5) Better Performance for Aggregate Functions: Functions like COUNT, MIN, MAX, etc., can benefit from indexes if they work on indexed columns.

**How Indexes Work**:

Indexes are typically created using **B-trees** or **hashes**. A B-tree index maintains a balanced tree structure where each node has pointers to other nodes or rows in the table. The search process traverses the tree, much like looking up a word in a dictionary. In the case of hash indexes, they use hash functions to map keys to specific locations in memory.


**Things to Keep in Mind**:

- Overhead: While indexes speed up read operations, they come with an overhead during INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE operations, because the index needs to be updated whenever the underlying table data changes.

- Storage: Indexes require additional storage space to maintain the index structure.

- Choosing the Right Index: Not all columns need indexes. Indexes are most useful for columns that are frequently queried or involved in joins, filters, or sorting operations.
